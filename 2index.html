        <h1>Groupers</h1>
        
        <div class="info"><p><span class="first-sentence">Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes),
            typically having a stout body and a large mouth.</span> They can be quite large, and lengths
            over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large
            group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it.
            They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing
            tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans.
            Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant grouper
            (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.</p>

        <p><span class="first-sentence">Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks
            their prey in from a distance.</span> They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form
            their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are
            so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they feel attacked and
            extend those muscles to lock themselves in.</p></div>

       <h2>Grouper's Grace</h2><br><br><br>
        <p class="grouper-poem">
            Beneath the waves, a giant sleeps,<br>
A mottled form, where mystery keeps.<br>
The grouper glides, a silent sight,<br>
A master of the shadows' night. <br><br>

With eyes that gleam, a watchful gaze,<br>
It moves with grace, in ocean's maze, <br>
A hunter's heart, a predator's soul,<br>
It stalks its prey, taking its toll.<br><br>

Its skin, a canvas, patterns bold,<br>
A masterpiece, stories untold. <br>
A creature of the deep, serene and strong, <br>
A symbol of the ocean's song.<br><br><br><br><br>

       <h2>Few facts about groupers</h2>
         <ol class="grouper-facts">
         <li>Powerful Predators:

            <ul>
                <li>Groupers are apex predators, sitting at the top of the food chain.</li>
                <li>They use a unique hunting technique called "suction feeding," allowing
                     them to quickly inhale prey.</li>
                <li>Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth make them efficient hunters.</li>
            </ul>

         </li> 

         <li>Social Gatherings:
            <ul>
                <li>Some grouper species form large aggregations during spawning season.</li>
                <li>These gatherings can involve hundreds or even thousands of individuals.</li>
                <li>The synchronized spawning behavior of these fish is a fascinating natural phenomenon.</li>

         </ol>
<p id="grouper-para">
     Groupers are fascinating creatures of the sea. These large, powerful fish are known for their
     impressive size, unique hunting techniques, and incredible adaptability. Some species are masters
     of disguise, blending seamlessly into their surroundings. As apex predators, groupers play a crucial
     role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Many species exhibit remarkable social
     behaviors, gathering in large groups during spawning season. Additionally, some groupers can change
     sex throughout their lives, a strategy that ensures reproductive success. While their longevity and
     slow growth rates make them vulnerable to overfishing, conservation efforts are underway to
     protect these magnificent creatures for future generations.
